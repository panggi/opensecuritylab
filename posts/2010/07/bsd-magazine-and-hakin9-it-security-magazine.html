<p>BSD was first published in June 2008. <p />  We decided to create a magazine for BSD users, enthusiasts and  communitites.  There were lots of Linux magazines and none devoted to BSD systems. Does  that  mean Linux is better than BSD? Not at all!<p />  In each issue we are trying to proove that BSD systems are reliable,  secure  and user-friendly.  <p />  Our authors are not only professionals with years of experience and BSD  gurus,  but also young hotheads who have lots of interesting things to say.<p />  The magazine is a free monthly publication, with 60 pages.</p>

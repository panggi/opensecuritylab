<span class="fn"><a href="http://twitter.com/codepo8" target="_blank">Christian Heilmann</a> , </span>a <span class="title">developer evangelist</span> living and working in <span class="adr"><span class="locality">London</span>, <span class="country-name">England ( </span></span>Yahoo! Senior Developer Evangelist ) wrote a handbook about developer evangelist. What is a developer evangelist ?? a developer evangelist is a spokesperson, mediator and translator  between a company and both its technical staff and outside developers.</p>
<p>You can see more here ( i quoted from his site <a href="http://developer-evangelism.com/handbook.php">http://developer-evangelism.com/handbook.php</a> ) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="clear: both;"><strong>Using the handbook you'll learn how to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Find great web content and promote it.</li>
<li>Write for the web and create engaging code examples.</li>
<li>Use the web and the social web to your advantage to reach, research and promote.</li>
<li>Prepare and deliver great presentations.</li>
</ul>
<p>For details check the <a href="http://developer-evangelism.com/toc.php">table of contents</a> also available on this page.</p>
<p><strong>And here's the message to give to your company why this is a good idea:</strong></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: small;">Why do you need developer evangelists?</span></h2>
<p>Every day millions of dollars are wasted in companies because  non-tech people and tech people either don't communicate at all or  completely miss each other's points.</p>
<p>Even more money is then spent on internal promotion of your products  or external communication and advertising to get people excited about  your new product.</p>
<p><strong>What you really need is enthusiasm about your product - honest interest in using it and the right message to the right group.</strong></p>
<p>If your product targets developers this can not be achieved with  marketing or PR. We've managed to remove the developer world from the  commercial part of IT companies so far over the last few years that  developers are very cynical about anything that does not relate to  technology first and brand second - and neither marketing nor PR can  deliver that.</p>
<p>Developers however are very happy to listen to what other developers  say - if these developers are very good, have their respect and deliver  the message in the right way.</p>
<p>The trick is to allow people in your company to play with your  products and advertise why they are excited about them - after all the  people in your company are consumers, too.</p>
<p>The best advertiser is someone who is not consciously advertising a  product but instead is so enthusiastic about it that it becomes  contagious. You can empower your developers to be these people without  much extra cost - all it needs is trust, a bit of time and to let them  off the leash.</p>

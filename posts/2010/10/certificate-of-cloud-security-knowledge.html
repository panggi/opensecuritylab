&ldquo;The CSA Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK) will  provide a consistent way of developing cloud security competency and  provide both organizations and agencies the confidence they need to  adopt secure cloud solutions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="names"><em>~ Melvin Greer, Chief Strategist, Cloud Computing, <a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.com/index.html">Lockheed Martin</a></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;The CSA, in providing a set of goals through the CCSK, is  challenging security practitioners to become the cloud thought-leaders  we need today and tomorrow to ensure safe and secure cloud environments.   In developing the CCSK, CSA is 'setting the bar' for security  professionals and providing business executives a means to gauge the  opinions and rhetoric associated with security in the cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="names"><em>~ Jerry Archer, CSO, <a href="http://www.salliemae.com/">Sallie Mae</a></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge  provides individuals with a solid foundation in cloud security issues  and best practices. Organizations that leverage this training will be  better positioned to get the most out of their investments in cloud  computing.  In addition, the certification can be a large help with  recruitment efforts as organizations can easily qualify the experience  of an individual in cloud security if they have earned the CCSK  certificate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="names"><em>~ Gary Phillips, senior director, technology assurance and standards research, <a href="http://www.symantec.com/">Symantec Corp</a></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;The launch of CSA&rsquo;s CCSK program is an important  step in improving security professionals&rsquo; understanding of cloud  security challenges and best practices and will lead to improved trust  of and increased use of cloud services.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="names"><em>~ Matthew Gardiner, Director, <a href="http://www.ca.com/us/default.aspx">CA Security Business<!--more--></a></em></p>
<p>"We have already been leveraging the CSA's <a href="http://www.cloudsecurityalliance.org/guidance">Security Guidance for Critical Areas in Cloud Computing</a> as a best practices manual for our information security staff. We now  plan to make this certification a requirement for our staff, to ensure  they have a solid baseline of understanding of the best practices for  securing data and applications in the cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="names"><em>~ Dave Cullinane, CISO and VP. <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay, Inc</a></em></p>
<p>"We applaud the CSA&rsquo;s initiative to provide this standard and new  certification program to enhance cloud security.  As the leading  cloud-based eDiscovery provider and the first to join the CSA we look  forward to helping drive the adoption of this certification standard in  the industry."</p>
<p class="names"><em>~ Peter Gaffney, Vice President of Systems and Network Operations, <a href="http://casecentral.com/"> CaseCentral</a></em></p>
<p>"Hubspan is committed to providing a secure and reliable cloud  computing environment for business integration and to helping companies  follow cloud security best practices, of which the CSA's CCSK  certification is a great example and one we fully support."</p>
<p class="names"><em>~ Ian Huynh, vice president of engineering and operations, <a href="http://hubspan.com/"> Hubspan Inc.</a></em></p>
<p>"This is the standards effort that the industry has been waiting  for.  As our studies have shown, security is the main topic holding back  the adoption of cloud computing. With the new CCSK certification  program, the CSA is continuing to provide the industry's most  comprehensive, prescriptive guidelines for baking security  best-practices into new cloud initiatives."</p>
<p class="names"><em>~ Guy Churchward, CEO, "<a href="http://loglogic.com/"> LogLogic</a></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;The CCSK is what is needed to help define and separate security  professionals who are interesting in making cloud security better,&rdquo; said  .  &ldquo;The term &ldquo;cloud computing&rdquo; has so many different meanings it&rsquo;s hard  to know if people are just throwing out buzz words or if they truly  understand its meaning.  The same can be said about cloud security,  there is a lot of talk about why cloud computing is insecure and what  needs to be done to make it secure. The CCSK program will help provide  the comprehensive understanding that is needed going forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="names"><em>~ David Lingenfelter, Information Security Officer, <a href="http://www.fiberlink.com/"> MaaS360 by Fiberlink</a></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;With CCSK certification, professionals who have Cloud Computing  responsibilities can demonstrate thorough Cloud security knowledge based  on the CSA&rsquo;s catalogue of security best practices.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="names"><em>~ Patrick Harding, CTO, <a href="http://www.pingidentity.com/"> Ping Identity</a></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK) is a natural step  for security, IT and other professionals to demonstrate their awareness  of cloud computing based on the Cloud Security Alliance Guidance v2.1.   This certification will address the demand for knowledgeable  professionals who can evaluate and implement cloud computing within  their organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="names"><em>~ Randy Barr, CSO, <a href="http://www.qualys.com/"> Qualys, Inc.</a></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Solutionary, Inc. is a corporate member of CSA, and has several  of their security consultants scheduled for the CSA certification  program.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="names"><em>~ Pamela Fusco, VP of industry solutions, <a href="http://www.solutionary.com/"> Solutionary, Inc.</a></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cloud Security Alliance&rsquo;s User Certification is a big step  forward in ensuring that IT professionals considering deploying  applications into the cloud understand security issues.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="names"><em>~ Todd Thiemann, Senior Director, Datacenter Security, <a href="http://www.trendmicro.com/"> Trend Micro</a></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Moving to the cloud is a significant risk management decision  for CIO and CISOs given unproven security models and reduced  indemnification.  Veracode has long been advocating for independent  security verification for the application development and delivery  ecosystem and we support the CSA&rsquo;s new user certification program as one  of the key pillars for building secure software.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="names"><em>~  Matt Moynahan, CEO,<a href="http://www.veracode.com/"> Veracode</a></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;CSA is pioneering the cloud computing industry by developing  programs to ensure that critical security needs are addressed. With the  newly created CCSK certification program, IT professionals and  businesses alike will benefit from the knowledge based training, helping  to provide greater surety that the appropriate security controls are  exercised when cloud based applications are adopted in the enterprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="names"><em>~ Nico Popp, vice president of product development, <a href="http://www.verisign.com/"> VeriSign</a></em></p>
<p>"Despite the clear agility and cost saving benefits, there are  factors which are holding back Cloud usage.  These include a deficit of  trust and reliability. Enterprises simply do not trust third-parties to  protect their sensitive data and connections to Cloud services may be  subject to delays and outages. With the new CCSK certification program,  the CSA is continuing to provide the industry's most comprehensive,  prescriptive guidelines for baking trust and reliability-oriented  security best-practices into new cloud initiatives."</p>
<p class="names"><em>~ Mark O'Neill, CTO, <a href="http://www.vordel.com/"> Vordel</a></em></p>
<p>"As enterprises move toward cloud computing, they are desperately  seeking guidance and education in this new domain.  CSA is bridging  this gap and the CCSK provides an important first step in establishing  baseline knowledge for individuals tasked with building and managing  applications to the cloud."</p>
<p class="names"><em>~ Michael Sutton, VP, Security Research, <a href="http://zscaler.com/"> Zscaler</a></em></p>
<p>"CCSK is a much needed next step in the evolution of secure cloud  computing because its guidelines are focused on tangible steps that can  be taken to assure organizations to take advantage of the benefits of  cloud computing in a secure and compliant manner."</p>

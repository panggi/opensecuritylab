<h5>Deploying &amp; Utilizing Intrusion Detection Using Snorby</h5>
<span class="cms_edition_article_lead"> </span>
<p>Snorby is an advanced Snort <span class="caps">IDS</span> front-end. Snorby has two basic fundamental pieces, which are  simplicity and power.

<h5>Malware Incident Response - Outbreak Scenario</h5>
<span class="cms_edition_article_lead"> </span>

<h5>TDSS botnet - full disclosure</h5>
<span class="cms_edition_article_lead"> </span>
<p>What is a botnet? A botnet is not merely an army of  infected computers. First of all, a botnet is an externally managed  complex structure.

<h5>When XOR is your friend...</h5>
<span class="cms_edition_article_lead"> </span>
<p>Using a random enough input stream may sound like  outright blasphemy to many if not all reading this; however in this  article I will demonstrate when using it makes sense. One of my hobbies  include creating crypto challenges where I hide an English message  string in a block of numbers and letters. The first challenger that can  correctly find what the message exactly states and demonstrate the  algorithm used (usually in a programmatic fashion) they win a cash  prize. I&rsquo;ve learned over this year that in the past I had been making it  far too difficult&hellip;</p>

<h5>Proactive Defenses and Free Tools</h5>
<span class="cms_edition_article_lead"> </span>
<p>In my last article, I described the greatest breach in  cyber history and made some suggestions on how it could have been  avoided &ndash; enabling strong wireless encryption, testing your wireless  routers for vulnerabilities, visiting <a href="http://nvd.nist.gov/">http://nvd.nist.gov</a>, limiting the number of trusted devices allowed<br /> on your wired and wireless networks and hardening your systems.</p>

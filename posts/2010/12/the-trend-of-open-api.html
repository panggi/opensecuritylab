<blockquote>
<p>Back in &rsquo;90 websites were having just one distribution channel (HTML),  now thanks to the API they can reach thousands of users through an API  being available everywhere, anyone can become an ubiquity platform.  Moreover back in &rsquo;90 there were just simple websites, now we have web,  mobile and devices applications running through the internet. Thus, the  power of information and data that can be used is so much powerful than  ever before: <em>"Not having an API today is like not having a website in the 90s"</em> says Martin Tantow co-founder of 3Scale.</p>
<p><strong>1995:&nbsp; </strong><strong>At the beginning&nbsp; there were just website</strong></p>
<p><strong>2005:</strong><strong>&nbsp; First websites with API as add-ons; they were a</strong><strong>n additional access/interface to their existing data: e.g Yelp</strong></p>
<p><strong>2008:</strong><strong>&nbsp; The API has overtaken website traffic, the API is more important than the website: e.g Twitter</strong></p>
<p><strong>2009:</strong> The API is the product and websites/webapps have become web services: e.g Twilio, Simplegeo</p>
<p><strong>Future:</strong> Web services become open platform, applications turn into platforms, everything is programmable and expandable</p>

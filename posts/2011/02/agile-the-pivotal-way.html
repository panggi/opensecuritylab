When i was in college , i learnt about Agile development just in theory and i don't really get it . It was supported by the reality that i coded in PHP, i mean no frameworks , object-oriented and procedural are all mixed up and i coded just for fun as long it's working and secure ( yea , i love secure programming ) .</p>
<p>Since i migrated to be a Rails programmer , i saw many new things that i didn't get from my way before. And because there's only a few Rails coder here in Indonesia , i don't have place to ask and share my problems. Thank GOD there's a cool things created by man named "The Internet".&nbsp;I read a lot of Ruby , Rails , TDD/BDD , How to deploy bla..bla . And not just books (pdf) , i also collecting the video casts and slides.</p>
<p>Some names appeared : Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz), 37signals , Heroku , Engine Yard , Github , Pivotal Labs , Hashrocket , Envylabs , DHH , Yehuda Katz , Dave Thomas , Michael Hartl , Jos&eacute; Valim , Obie Fernandez , Greg Pollack , Sam Ruby , TextMate , RubyMine and many more.</p>
<p>And what i love from what my condition right now is : "liberated" . And now , i have something like a new culture that i love to be with.</p>
<p>Back to Agile , this methodology is used by most of Rails developer . But it's not a "one size fits all" , they are flexible to the certain condition. These video and slide are presenting about "Agile the Pivotal Way" by&nbsp;Ian McFarland, Principal and VP of Technology for Pivotal Labs.</p>
<p>The video duration is 49:45 and you can download it here in mp4 format : <a href="http://assets.pivotallabs.com/talks/06-23-2010_Agile-Pivotal-Way_Ian-McFarland.mp4">Agile the Pivotal Way</a></p>

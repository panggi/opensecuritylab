Believe  it or not, Google wants to give money to hackers. If you can help them  find security vulnerabilities and help keep their Web apps safe, you could  earn a cash reward!</span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wanted by Google: Bounty-hunting hackers who can find security vulnerabilities in popular Web apps.</p>
<p>For security researchers who find flaws in Internet services like  Gmail, Blogger and YouTube, Google will reward $500 or more per bug.  Vulnerabilities that are "severe or unusually clever" pay up to  $3,133.70. Optionally, benevolent hackers can also donate their rewards  to charity, in which case Google will match the winnings at its  discretion.</p>
<p>Bug-hunting researchers will also be credited on <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/security.html">Google's security page</a>.</p>
<p>To keep Web services running smoothly, Google is excluding bugs  caused by denial of service attacks and search optimization tricks.  Technologies recently acquired by Google are also off-limits.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Google has opened up security research to the masses with cash rewards. In January, the company <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/188200/google_pays_for_chrome_bug_reports.html">announced a bounty program</a> for Chromium, the open-source project behind Google's Chrome Web browser, following the lead of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/security/bug-bounty.html">Mozilla's Firefox bounty program</a>.</p>
<p>The move to Web apps, however, is an important and logical step for  Google. The company is putting a lot of faith in Web apps as the future  of computing, as <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/196778/google_chrome_web_app_store_5_things_you_should_know.html">evidenced by the upcoming Chrome OS</a>. If users are going to store more and more sensitive information into online services, those services need to be secure.</p>
<p>In the future, Google may expand the program to client applications  such as Android, Picasa and Google desktop. Let's hope that happens  soon; analysis firm Coverity recently <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/209419/88_highrisk_defects_found_in_android_kernel.html">found 88 high-risk defects</a> in the Android kernel.</p>
